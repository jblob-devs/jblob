## How to install the server

To install the server, you need to have nodejs installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have nodejs installed, you can run the following commands in the terminal to install the server:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all the dependencies needed to run the server.

## How to run the server

make sure to have nodejs installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have nodejs installed, you can run the following commands in the terminal to start the server:

```
nodemon index.js
```

or

```
node index.js
```

The first command is preferred because it restarts the server automatically when you make changes to the code.
