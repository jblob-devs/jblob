            The mechanics for upgrades and customizing
            basic upgrading: basic stat boosts, boosts level, costs light shards + possibly something else
            rank up: blob bits of that same blob?
            rune slots: at max level, 6 rune slots, runes work as mini modifiers
                        ex. a rune could give a flat +5% dmg buff
                            or give +5 health to that blob when u use a card
            Their energy attacks, i.e., a detail of the cost and what each special attack does
            Lightcore ability info (if the blob has one)
