Alright here's the gist...

To start the server, you need to have nodejs installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have nodejs installed, you can run the following commands in the terminal to start the server:

```
nodemon index.js
```
or
```
node index.js
```

The first command is preferred because it restarts the server automatically when you make changes to the code. 
The second command is only used when you want to start the server and not make any changes to the code. 

 - If you use the second command, you will have to stop the server and start it again to see the changes you made to the code.
 - To stop the server, you can press ctrl + c in the terminal.

Once the server is running, you can access the frontend by going to http://localhost:3000
